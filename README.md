# NoteForge – A Full-Stack Note-Taking Application

NoteForge is a lightweight, developer-friendly note-taking web application designed with modern frameworks. It provides an efficient interface for users to create, edit, and manage their notes with secure authentication and seamless deployment.

## Overview
The application aims to solve the problem of bloated, resource-heavy note-taking tools by providing a minimal yet functional platform. NoteForge is simple enough for everyday use while maintaining scalability for future enhancements.

## Features
1. User authentication and authorization  
2. Create, read, update, and delete notes  
3. Organized and reusable component structure  
4. Responsive user interface for both desktop and mobile  
5. Real-time note updates using React hooks  
6. Cloud deployment for universal access  

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (React + TypeScript)  
- Backend: API routes with Node.js  
- Database: Drizzle ORM with SQL schema and migrations  
- Styling: Tailwind CSS  
- Deployment: Vercel  

## Project Structure
- **/app** – Next.js routes and pages  
- **/components** – Reusable UI components (note editor, buttons, forms)  
- **/db** – Database schema and migrations (Drizzle ORM)  
- **/hooks** – Custom React hooks for state and API handling  
- **/lib** – Utility functions for authentication and configuration  
- **/server** – API endpoints for authentication and notes CRUD  
- **/public** – Static assets  

## How It Works
1. A user signs up or logs in, with authentication handled by secure API routes.  
2. Notes can be created, edited, or deleted. Data is stored and managed via Drizzle ORM.  
3. The frontend displays notes dynamically using React components.  
4. The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS to remain responsive.  
5. The application is deployed on Vercel for serverless scalability.  

## Future Enhancements
- Support for rich text and Markdown editing  
- Note categorization and tagging  
- Sharing functionality for collaborative use  
- Offline access through Progressive Web App (PWA) support
